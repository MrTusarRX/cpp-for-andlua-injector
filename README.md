# Memory Injection & Modification for Games

## Overview
Memory injection and modification involve altering a game's runtime memory to modify values, unlock hidden features, or change in-game behavior. This technique is commonly used in game modding, debugging, and cheating.

## How It Works
1. **Process Identification**  
   - The target game's process is located using tools like Cheat Engine, Process Hacker, or a custom-built memory scanner.

2. **Memory Scanning**  
   - The memory regions of the process are scanned to locate specific values (e.g., health, ammo, score).
   - Values are typically stored in static or dynamic memory addresses.

3. **Memory Modification**  
   - Once the correct address is found, it can be modified to a desired value.
   - Example: Changing a health value from `100` to `9999`.

4. **Code Injection (Optional)**  
   - A custom DLL or external script is injected into the game process to modify behavior dynamically.
   - This can be used to hook functions, bypass anti-cheat mechanisms, or execute custom scripts.

5. **Pointer & Offset Handling**  
   - Dynamic memory addresses require finding pointers and offsets to maintain modifications after game restarts.

## Tools & Languages Used
- **Cheat Engine** – Memory scanning and modification
- **C++** / **C#** – DLL injection and memory manipulation
- **Python** – Automating memory scanning with libraries like `pymem`
- **Assembly (ASM)** – Understanding game instructions for advanced modifications

## Risks & Considerations
- **Anti-Cheat Detection** – Many online games have anti-cheat mechanisms that detect memory modification.
- **Legal & Ethical Issues** – Modifying memory in online games can lead to bans or legal consequences.
- **Game Crashes** – Incorrect memory edits can cause the game to crash or behave unexpectedly.

## Example Code (C++)
```cpp
#include <windows.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    DWORD processID = 1234; // Replace with actual game process ID
    HANDLE hProcess = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, processID);

    if (hProcess) {
        int newValue = 9999;
        LPVOID address = (LPVOID)0x12345678; // Replace with actual memory address
        WriteProcessMemory(hProcess, address, &newValue, sizeof(newValue), NULL);
        CloseHandle(hProcess);
        std::cout << "Memory modified successfully!" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Failed to open process!" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
